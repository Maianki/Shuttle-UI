<h2> <strong> Here's a quick rundown on how to make a contribution to our project: </strong> </h2>

    <br>

    <br>
    <li>Clone the repository to your local machine using: <strong> git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git. </strong></li>
    <br>
    <li>Add the upstream remote:<strong> git remote add upstream https://github.com/Maianki/Shuttle-UI.git </strong> </li>
    <br>
    <li>Pull the latest changes from the main repository if you think your fork is behind: <strong> git pull upstream main </strong> </li>
